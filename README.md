|----------------|------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Development    | http://dev.example.com       | DevDeployJob       | 1. Check out the code from the development branch.         |
|                |                              |                    | 2. Run unit tests to ensure code quality.                  |
|                |                              |                    | 3. Build the application.                                 |
|                |                              |                    | 4. Deploy to the development server.                       |
| Staging        | http://staging.example.com   | StagingDeployJob   | 1. Merge code into the staging branch.                    |
|                |                              |                    | 2. Run integration tests on the staging server.            |
|                |                              |                    | 3. Build the application with staging configurations.      |
