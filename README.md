| Test Type            | Description                                                                                     | Execution Command             |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Unit Tests           | Test individual components or functions in isolation.                                           | `npm run test:unit`           |
| Integration Tests    | Verify the interaction between multiple components or systems.                                   | `npm run test:integration`    |
| End-to-End Tests     | Test the entire application flow from start to finish.                                           | `npm run test:e2e`            |
| Performance Tests    | Evaluate the system's responsiveness and stability under different conditions.                 | `npm run test:performance`   |
| Security Scans       | Identify and address security vulnerabilities in the codebase.                                   | `npm run test:security`      |
| Code Coverage        | Assess the percentage of code covered by tests.                                                  | `npm run test:coverage`      |

**Note**: Ensure you have the testing environment set up as described in the [Testing Environment Setup](#testing-environment-setup) section.

### Test Scenarios

## Deployments <a name="deployments"></a>

Facilitate smooth deployments across different environments:

| Environments   | Environment URLs             | Jenkins Jobs       | Deployment Instructions                                     |
|----------------|------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Development    | http://dev.example.com       | DevDeployJob       | 1. Retrieve code from the development branch, execute unit tests, and deploy on the development server. Double-check each deployment step! |
| Staging        | http://staging.example.com   | StagingDeployJob   | 1. Merge code into the staging branch.                     |
|                |                              |                    | 2. Run integration tests on the staging server.            |
|                |                              |                    | 3. Build the application with staging configurations.      |
|                |                              |                    | 4. Deploy to the staging server.                           |
| Production     | http://www.example.com       | ProductionDeployJob| 1. Ensure a proper code merge. Merging into the development branch will trigger automatic deployment.                  |
|                |                              |                    | 2. After merging, perform a sanity check.                   |
