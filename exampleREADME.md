# Question-bank-fe

QBG (Question Bank Generator) is a system which has a multitude of structured questions and answers on a range of topics for the classes/batches. These questions and answers can be used to auto-generate (database-driven) template based SEO landing pages. SEO is an important user acquisition channel and implementation of the database driven SEO landing pages will boost the SEO traffic to our website. With proper schema markup implementation, these Q&As also show up as a "Questions and answers" featured snippet on SERP.

## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Briefly introduce the project here.
QBG (Question Bank Generator) is a system which has a multitude of structured questions and answers on a range of topics for the classes/batches. These questions and answers can be used to auto-generate (database-driven) template based SEO landing pages. SEO is an important user acquisition channel and implementation of the database driven SEO landing pages will boost the SEO traffic to our website. With proper schema markup implementation, these Q&As also show up as a "Questions and answers" featured snippet on SERP. 

## Project Overview <a name="project-overview"></a>

- **Purpose**: Explain the project's purpose.
The objective is:
Students should be able to find PW Q&A page while searching for questions on Google - Acquisition through search engine
Students should be able to navigate to the Q&A page while searching for questions directly on PW web - ease of usage for PW's captive   audience (increase adoption of Q&A section)
Image and text search both should be supported on PW - Ask doubt capability of Saarthi - To be enabled on website as well
Students are able to utilise QBG for practising topic-wise problems with filters and sort options like difficulty level, popularity, previous year questions - QBG categorisation to be enhanced as well 
Identify the next action(s) we want the user to take

- **Features**: List key features.
Students will search questions without login . 
They can upload images of questions and get response 

- **Architecture**: Describe the technology stack and project structure.
Will be using NextJs to create all components

Shared Components yet to be decided to use npm package or submodules

SSR or SSG pages will be decided based on stress test on NextJs

Unit test will be incorporated using Jest and react testing library

Typescript will be used with proper type check

Linting will be done (next lint / other industry standard linting)

Pre commit hooks will be incorporated â€“ Husky

Will Dockerise 

Creation of CI/CD pipeline in gitlab for linting and test case coverage

Will use third party carousel for slider

| Environments   | Environment URLs             | Jenkins Jobs       | Deployment Instructions                                     |
|----------------|------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Development    | ---                                  | -----       | 1. Check out the code from the development branch.         |
|                |                              |                    | 2. Run unit tests to ensure code quality.                  |
|                |                              |                    | 3. Build the application.                                 |
|                |                              |                    | 4. Deploy to the development server.                       |
| Staging        | https://pw-qbg-stage.penpencil.co/question-answer/  | https://jenkins.penpencil.co/job/Staging/job/pw-qbg/   | 1. Merge code into the staging branch.                    |
|                |                              |                    | 2. Run integration tests on the staging server.            |
|                |                              |                    | 3. Build the application with staging configurations.      |
|                |                              |                    | 4. Deploy to the staging server.                           |
| Production     | https://www.pw.live/question-answer      | https://jenkins.penpencil.co/job/Production/job/pw-qbg/ | 1. Ensure a proper code merge. Merging code into the development branch will automatically trigger deployment to the development environment.                  |
|                |                              |                    | 2. After merging the code, please perform a sanity check.    |
